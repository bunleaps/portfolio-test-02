Keep it clean, keep it clever, and ship it.

## Who is Buns?

I'm Bunleap – but people kept mispronouncing it, so now I go by Buns.  
I’m a developer who likes clean code, broken things, and the thrill of making things work again.

I don’t just write code – I build things that (mostly) don’t crash.

Currently exploring: 🧠 AI, 🛠️ backend systems, and 🕹️ building stuff for fun.

Reach me at bunleap.sorn@gmail.com or yell into the void (but email works better).
